## Update notes

- No BCSV changes in v1.1.2

## General Tools

### debug\_tools.py + pynoexs.py

Basic Python port of the Noexes client for poking the game's memory on a running Switch: https://github.com/mdbell/Noexes

## BCSVs (Binary CSV data tables)

### bcsv.py

Minimal library for reading AC:NH's binary CSV files.

### specs.py

Auto-generated specifications (using build\_specs.py and the enumerations JSON) for the BCSV schema. Most names are missing right now...

### dump\_all\_to\_html.py

Outputs a batch of HTML files containing crude table views of all the BCSV files.

## Message Data

### msbt.py

Minimal library for reading the MSBT format used inside the game's message archives.

### scrape\_item\_names.py

Dumps the names of all items to item\_names.json.

## Island Map Data

### pbc.py

Minimal library for reading AC:NH's collision and heightmap files.

### display\_pbc.py

Crudely renders the contents of a single PBC file to a PNG using Pillow.

### render\_map.py

Renders a map from a decrypted savefile, using the collision data as a source for the layout data (because the actual maps in the game are based off the 3D geometry, and I'm not writing a BFRES renderer). Pretty incomplete at the moment. Depends on `zstandard`, `sarc` and Pillow.

### render\_mystery\_island.py

Generates the data for my famed Mystery Tour Island guide.

## EventFlow

### evfl/eventflow\_actor\_info.json

A list of every single EventFlow action/query that gets called in the game's EventFlow files.

### evfl/eventflow\_vtables.json

Addresses in v1.1.4 for the vtables for all EventFlow actions/queries.

## Savefiles

### savefile/parse\_smmh.py

Parses the schema files present in /System/Smmh/ on the game's RomFS (except for v1.0.0!) and outputs information.

### savefile/dump\_save\_io\_structs.py

Talks to a Switch running ACNH under Noexs to extract information about the SaveIO class hierarchy that the game uses when accessing savefile data.

### savefile/all\_save\_field\_keys.json

A list of all hashes present for type and field names in the savefile schema.

### savefile/save\_keys.json

A manually curated list of field names. May contain a couple of inaccuracies due to hash collisions, but I've tried to eliminate as many as possible!

### savefile/bruteforce\_save\_fields3.py

Various strategies for trying to figure out as many of the hashes as possible.

### savefile/save\_io\_structure.json

Pre-generated SaveIO structure for v1.1.4.

### savefile/save\_schema\_*.json

Pre-generated schemas for the savefile format, including original type/field names from save\_keys.json.

### savefile/save\_schema\_*\_pseudoC.h

Vaguely readable pseudo-C output. Not usable in its direct form due to missing information on types not included in the schema (primitive types that haven't been figured out, Switch SDK stuff, etc).

### savefile/editor/*, captureData.py

Browser-based editor for savefiles. Right now it's really just a viewer, to be honest... Built in TypeScript with Bootstrap and Fancytree.

## Ghidra Scripts

### ACEnumScraper2.py

Analyses the game's executable to find all the enumerations used in BCSV files (which helpfully come with both English names and Japanese descriptions) and generates a JSON file containing them.

### ACNHSaveSchemaV3.py

Imports all the structures from the savefile schema into a Ghidra database.

### FunHelper.py

Various things I used while analysing the v1.1.4 executable to make it more amenable to reverse-engineering in Ghidra (forcing all functions to be discovered, etc).

### BuildRTTIHierarchy.py

Introspects the RTTI information for a class to build out the inheritance chain and name all of the vtables and their methods. Slightly limited, right now it's specialised towards the EventFlow receptors.

### IntrospectBCSVs.py

An older version of the RTTI code specialised towards the classes that read BCSV files.
